# stack-templates


## Synopsis

My personal stack templates


## Description

Stack can use a template to scaffold up a new project and has a facility to
allow anyone to make and share templates. These are mine.

    stack-generic    Simple Haskell project that builds with stack
    stack-nix        Simple Haskell project that builds with stack, with or without nix. Uses modern nix flakes.
    stack-nix-shell  Simple Haskell project that builds with stack, with or without nix. Uses classic nix-shell.


## Development

To create a project with one of these templates

    $ stack new my-project github:dino-/stack-nix
